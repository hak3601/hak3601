## About Me 👨‍💻

### Research Interests
I am currently studying **Computer Science and Engineering** at Chung-Ang University and working as a **Research Student** at the **Data Mining And Intelligence Systems (DMAIS) Lab**. My primary focus lies in:

- **Data Mining**: Developing scalable and efficient models to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.
- **Recommender Systems**: Enhancing user experiences through personalized recommendations by tackling challenges such as real-time processing and large-scale data.
- **Trustworthy AI**: Exploring Fairness-aware Graph Mining Models.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Exploring how LLMs can be applied to graphs or graph data to uncover new insights and enable advanced applications.
- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**: Creating user-centric, data-informed systems to address real-world social challenges.

### Personal Interests
In addition to my research, I am passionate about:
- ☕ Exploring cafes and tasting different coffee beans.
- 📸 Photography to capture moments and connect with nature.
- 🎥 Watching movies and taking reflective walks to stay inspired.
