## About Me 👨‍💻

I am a **Computer Science and Engineering** undergraduate and a **Research Intern** at the **DMAIS Lab**, focusing on **Data Mining**, **Recommender Systems**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. 

My current research explores how to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets to build efficient and scalable recommendation models. By leveraging techniques in data mining and machine learning, I aim to enhance user experiences through personalized recommendations, tackling challenges such as large-scale data processing and real-time recommendation generation.

In addition to Data Mining, I have a strong interest in **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, particularly in its potential to solve social problems through data-driven solutions. I am fascinated by how HCI can optimize the way humans interact with technology, and how this can be applied to design systems that address real-world social issues. I am especially keen on developing user-centric, data-informed systems that foster better decision-making and enhance societal well-being.
